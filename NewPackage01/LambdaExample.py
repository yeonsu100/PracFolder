# Python program to test map, filter and lambda

# Function to test map
def cube(x):
    return x ** 2


# Driver to test above function

# Program for working of map
print
"MAP EXAMPLES"
cubes = map(cube, range(10))
print
cubes

print
"LAMBDA EXAMPLES"

# first parentheses contains a lambda form, that is
# a squaring function and second parentheses represents
# calling lambda
print(lambda x: x ** 2)(5)

# Make function of two arguments that return their product
print(lambda x, y: x * y)(3, 4)

print
"FILTER EXAMPLE"
special_cubes = filter(lambda x: x > 9 and x < 60, cubes)
print
